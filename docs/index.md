# {{ page.title }}

This site has been created to document my approach to sample **Acme Ltd** case study.

Here I will:

- Capture the requirements and assumptions.
- Present solution options and rationale for selected options.
- Present a business case for the solution.
- Present a brief overall design.
- Point to the GitHub repo where this solution is stored.

To proceed, please follow the navigation links above.
